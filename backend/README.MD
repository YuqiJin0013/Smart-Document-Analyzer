## Build Backend by using Flask

### Imports: It imports necessary modules such as Flask, NLTK, Flask-CORS, logging, FPDF, and reportlab.

### App Initialization: It initializes a Flask application and enables CORS for frontend requests.

### NLTK Setup: It downloads necessary NLTK data required for text processing tasks like sentiment analysis, text summarization, and keyword extraction.

### Text Processing Functions:
* analyze_sentiment(text): Analyzes the sentiment of the input text using NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.
* text_summarization(text): Generates a summary of the input text by extracting the first three sentences.
* keyword_extraction(text): Extracts keywords from the input text by tokenizing, filtering stop words, and lemmatizing the words.

### API Endpoints:
* /api/upload-file: Accepts file uploads.
* /api/nlp/generate-document: Processes text data, performs sentiment analysis, generates a summary, extracts keywords, creates a PDF report, and returns the analysis results.

### Error Handling: It handles exceptions during NLP processing and logs errors to a log file.

### Main Execution: It starts the Flask development server when the script is executed directly.
